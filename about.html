                I am seeking full-time employment as a junior developer. I will 
                be available to begin January 2021.<br />
                <br />
                I have completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science as of 
                December 2020, with the convocation in April 2021.<br />
                <br />
                I have experience with coding in C++, JavaScript, and Java. Through 
                my classes, I have gained experience with HTML, CSS, prototyping software, 
                version control, Docker, design principles, and development processes, 
                including web development. This semester I collaborated on a project using 
                Bootstrap and Handlebars for the project’s front-end and ExpressJS and JSDoc 
                for the project’s back-end. I am a fast, independent learner with strong 
                teamwork skills.<br />
                <br />
                Since September of 2019 I have been employed by the University of Saskatchewan 
                as a teaching assistant and marker. The courses I have been employed to lead 
                tutorials for are CMPT270 (Developing Object-Oriented Systems), CMPT281 (Website 
                Design and Development), and CMPT370 (Intermediate Software Engineering). In 
                these positions I have demonstrated strong interpersonal skills and the ability 
                to assist others in problem solving.<br />
